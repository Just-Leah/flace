Figura model where anyone can add anything.

## Rules

Only a few rules exist.

Make sure none of it is NSFW or discrimonary. Use common sense.

Make sure that the model does not exceed the upload limit.

Don't purposefully overwrite something that somebody has created, unless to optimise it.

## How do I do it?

Fork it, edit it a bit, open a PR. I'll look at it, otherwise nudge me in the Blancworks discord to do it.
